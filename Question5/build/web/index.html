    <center><h3> The Servlet Model </h3></center>
    We talk about the basic concepts of the Servlet model. This web application contains the following examples from the slide. 

    <ol>
        <li>This web application also implements the simple banking application explained in the slide. Here is the <a href="login.html">Login page</a> for the application<br>
            As explained, the usernames/passwords are hard coded in the LoginServlet. You can use any of the following values:<br>
            1. ann/aaa<br>
            2. john/jjj<br>
            3. mark/mmm<br>
            <br>
            Once you login, you should see the account information of the user.
    </ol>
    
    <a href="changePassword.html">Change Password</a>
